# Project Report on Quantium Data Analytics Project

I undertook a comprehensive analysis of the transaction data provided by the client for Quantium. The primary objective was to identify customer purchasing behavior, assess the impact of trial store layouts on sales, and provide actionable recommendations for the client's strategy. This project report outlines the methodologies I employed, key findings, and the commercial recommendations derived from the data analysis.

## Task One: Data Preparation and Customer Analytics

I started by examining and cleaning the transaction and customer data provided by the client. Leveraging various data analysis techniques, I identified distinct customer segments based on their purchasing behavior. I developed key metrics to examine sales drivers comprehensively and gain insights into the overall sales performance. Utilizing visualization techniques, I presented data insights effectively, formulating clear commercial recommendations for the client's strategy.

# Key Findings:

1. Segmentation Analysis: I identified several distinct customer segments based on their purchasing behavior, enabling the client to tailor their marketing strategies accordingly.

2. Sales Performance Metrics: I pinpointed specific factors that significantly impacted the overall sales performance, providing valuable insights into optimizing the client's sales strategy.

# Commercial Recommendations:

1. Targeted Marketing Strategies: I recommended tailoring marketing campaigns to specific customer segments identified through the segmentation analysis to maximize the effectiveness of promotional activities.

2. Sales Optimization: I suggested focusing on key sales drivers identified during the analysis to enhance overall sales performance and improve profitability.

# Task Two: Experimentation and Uplift Testing

Building on the insights gained from Task One, my analysis extended to identifying benchmark stores for conducting uplift testing on the impact of trial store layouts on customer sales. I selected control stores based on predefined metrics and conducted thorough statistical analysis to assess the differences in sales. I summarized the findings and formulated actionable recommendations based on the results.

# Key Findings:

1. Control Store Selection: I carefully analyzed and selected benchmark stores that closely mirrored the trial stores, ensuring a reliable basis for comparison.

2. Sales Impact Assessment: By comparing the performance of trial stores with the selected control stores, I accurately gauged the impact of the trial store layouts on customer sales, enabling me to provide data-driven recommendations for the client.

# Recommendations:

1. Layout Optimization: I recommended implementing successful layout strategies identified during the experimentation phase across all stores to potentially boost overall sales.

2. Continuous Monitoring: I proposed establishing a systematic process for monitoring and evaluating store performance to ensure that the implemented strategies consistently align with the evolving market trends and customer preferences.

# Task Three: Analytics and Commercial Application

Drawing upon the insights and analyses from Tasks One and Two, I prepared a comprehensive report for the Category Manager, following the structured approach outlined in the Pyramid Principles framework. The report incorporated visually appealing data representations, key insights, and actionable recommendations, providing the client with a clear understanding of the analytical findings and their implications for the business.

# Key Components of the Report:

1. Pyramid Principles Framework: I structured the report in a logical and coherent manner, with a clear hierarchy of information flow, ensuring that the key takeaways were effectively communicated to the client.

2. Data Visualizations and Key Callouts: I utilized engaging visualizations to present the findings in an easily digestible format, facilitating a better understanding of the complex data insights.

3. Actionable Insights and Recommendations: The report concluded with actionable insights and recommendations derived from the data analysis, enabling the client to make informed strategic decisions aligned with the identified market trends and customer preferences.

# Conclusion

Through my comprehensive analysis of the transaction data and experimentation with store layouts, I provided valuable insights and recommendations for the client's strategic decision-making process. The data-driven approach employed in this project not only enhanced the client's understanding of customer behavior but also equipped them with actionable strategies to drive sales growth and improve overall business performance.
